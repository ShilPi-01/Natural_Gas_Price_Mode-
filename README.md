# Natural_Gas_Price_Model
Time-series analysis of monthly natural gas prices to identify trend and seasonality, with interpolation for historical dates and extrapolation for one-year forward pricing to support storage contract valuation.

## Objective
- Analyze historical natural gas prices
- Identify trend and seasonality
- Interpolate prices for missing dates
- Extrapolate prices for longer-term storage contracts

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- SciPy
- statsmodels

## Methodology
- Time-series visualization
- Seasonal decomposition
- Linear interpolation
- One-year extrapolation
- Price estimation function

## Output
A reusable Python function that takes a date as input and returns an estimated natural gas price.

## Use Case
Supports indicative pricing of natural gas storage contracts by enabling traders to evaluate buy, store, and sell decisions.
